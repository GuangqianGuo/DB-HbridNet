# DB-HbridNet
Go deep or broad? Exploit hybrid network architecture for weakly supervised object classiÔ¨Åcation and localization.
# Overview
We propose a novel hybrid network, namely DB-HybridNet, which combines deep CNNs with a broad learning network to learn discriminative and complementary features from different layers, and then integrates multi-level features (i.e.high-level semantic features and low-level edge features) in a global feature augmentation module.
